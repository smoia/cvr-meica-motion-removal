description: Considering the relationship between FD and DVARS and the ICC analysis, a conservative ME-ICA denoising approach is the best way to reduce impact of motion without compromising reliability in CVR mapping. Otherwise, a conventional optcom approach is recommended, but with less reduction of motion effects.

Considering the relationship between FD and DVARS and the ICC analysis, a conservative ME-ICA denoising approach is the best way to reduce impact of motion without compromising reliability in CVR mapping. Otherwise, a conventional optcom approach is recommended, but with less reduction of motion effects. Further studies should extend these results to other fMRI with substantial collinear artefacts
