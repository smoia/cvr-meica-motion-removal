Considering the relationship between FD and DVARS (Fig. 4) and the ICC analysis (Fig. 5), a conservative ME-ICA denoising approach is the best way to reduce impact of motion without compromising reliability in CVR mapping. Otherwise, a conventional optcom approach is recommended, but with less reduction of motion effects. Further studies should extend these results to other fMRI with substantial collinear artefacts

slope in the correlation means lower residual motion effects and better motion denoising.*

*Figure 5: Thresholded (>0.4) voxelwise ICC(2,1) of CVR and lag in MNI space. Note how optcom and meica-con have the best reliability
for both CVR and lag maps, while meica-agg has the lowest in both. ICC below 0.4 indicates poor reliability.*
